## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the analysis of a compromised Ubuntu Linux web server honeypot that experienced sustained SSH brute-force attacks resulting in multiple successful account compromises. The investigation reveals extensive unauthorized access, account creation activities, reconnaissance tool installation, and firewall rule modifications by multiple threat actors over a 47-day period.

The compromise demonstrates a multi-attacker scenario where the root account was successfully breached after 5,479 failed login attempts, followed by system reconnaissance, installation of scanning tools (nmap), creation of backdoor accounts, and firewall configuration changes.

## 11. Impact Assessment

### 11.1 System Compromise Severity

* **Full Root Access:** Complete system control achieved by multiple attackers
* **Persistent Access:** Backdoor accounts created for long-term access
* **Network Reconnaissance:** Scanning tools installed for further attacks
* **Firewall Manipulation:** Security controls modified to allow additional access
* **Database Exposure:** Complete database access without authentication

### 11.2 Honeypot Analysis Context

**Note:** This system appears to be intentionally configured as a honeypot for security research, which explains:
- Weak/default credentials allowing successful brute-force
- Passwordless database root accounts
- Extended attacker access without remediation
- Comprehensive logging of attacker activities

The compromise demonstrates real-world SSH brute-force attack patterns, multi-stage post-exploitation activities, and attacker techniques for maintaining persistent access.

- **Persistence:** Sustained attacks over weeks

### 12.2 Post-Exploitation
- **Reconnaissance:** nmap tool installation
- **Persistence:** Backdoor account creation (wind3str0y)
- **Defense Evasion:** Firewall rule modifications
- **Lateral Movement Preparation:** Network scanning capabilities

### 12.3 Operational Security
- **Proxy Usage:** pxyscand/2.1 for anonymization
- **Multiple IPs:** Distributed attack infrastructure

‚úÖ **Conclusion:**

The Hammered honeypot successfully captured a real-world SSH brute-force attack campaign spanning 47 days with 6 successful attacker IP addresses compromising the root account. The most active attacker (219.150.161.20) achieved 4 successful root logins on April 19, 2010, with the final observed access at 05:56:05 AM. Post-compromise activities included installation of the nmap reconnaissance tool, creation of the wind3str0y backdoor account on April 26 at 04:43:15, and addition of 6 firewall rules to enable persistent access. The investigation also revealed critical MySQL security vulnerabilities with 2 passwordless root database accounts persisting throughout the entire incident period. The honeypot data demonstrates typical attacker behavior patterns including reconnaissance, privilege maintenance, and infrastructure modification for sustained access.
