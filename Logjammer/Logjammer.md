- **Answer**: 27/03/2023 14:37:09
- **Event ID Used**: 4624
- **Source Log**: Security.evtx
- **Event Definition**: Successful logon events - logged when a user successfully authenticates to the system
- **Significance**: Establishes the initial timeline of user activity

### Firewall Configuration Tampering

#### Tasks 2-3: Firewall Rule Manipulation
- **Rule Addition Question**: The user tampered with firewall settings on the system. What is the Name of the firewall rule added?

## TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Mapping

| Tactic | Technique | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Persistence** | T1053.005 - Scheduled Task/Job | HTB-AUTOMATION task creation |
| **Defense Evasion** | T1562.004 - Disable/Modify System Firewall | Metasploit C2 Bypass rule |
| **Defense Evasion** | T1070.001 - Clear Windows Event Logs | Firewall log clearing |
| **Defense Evasion** | T1562.002 - Disable Windows Event Logging | Audit policy modification |
| **Discovery** | T1087 - Account Discovery | SharpHound AD enumeration tool |
| **Command and Control** | T1071.001 - Web Protocols | Outbound firewall bypass rule |

### Attack Patterns
1. **Initial Access**: User authentication to establish foothold
2. **Defense Evasion**: Firewall rule creation to bypass network restrictions
3. **Persistence**: Scheduled task creation for recurring execution
4. **Discovery**: SharpHound deployment for AD reconnaissance 
5. **Anti-Forensics**: Event log clearing to destroy evidence

## Key Findings

### IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- **User Account**: CyberJunkie
- **Firewall Rule**: "Metasploit C2 Bypass"
- **Scheduled Task**: HTB-AUTOMATION
- **Script Path**: C:\Users\CyberJunkie\Desktop\Automation-HTB.ps1
- **Email Parameter**: cyberjunkie@hackthebox.eu
- **Malware**: SharpHound-v1.1.0.zip

### Security Implications
1. **Firewall Bypass**: Creation of C2 bypass rule indicates attempted external communication
2. **Persistence Mechanism**: Daily scheduled task ensures continued access
3. **AD Reconnaissance**: SharpHound suggests preparation for lateral movement
4. **Audit Evasion**: Policy modifications reduce security visibility
5. **Evidence Destruction**: Log clearing demonstrates anti-forensic awareness

### Detection Gaps
- **PowerShell Logging**: Limited to single command execution
- **Network Monitoring**: No evidence of actual C2 communication
- **File System Monitoring**: Missing file creation/modification events
- **Process Execution**: Lack of process creation logging

---

## Conclusion
This investigation reveals a sophisticated multi-phase attack involving firewall manipulation, scheduled task persistence, and Active Directory reconnaissance. The attacker demonstrated advanced knowledge of Windows logging and attempted to evade detection through audit policy modification and log clearing. The presence of SharpHound indicates preparation for lateral movement within the Active Directory environment. The timeline spanning nearly 11 months suggests either a long-term persistent threat or multiple related incidents requiring further investigation.
