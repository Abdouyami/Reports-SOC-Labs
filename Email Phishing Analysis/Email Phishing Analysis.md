âœ… **Conclusion:**
The analysis of this phishing campaign reveals a sophisticated social engineering attack that combines technical deception with complex psychological manipulation. While the threat actor "Pestero Negeja" demonstrates moderate technical capability using anonymous email services and file obfuscation techniques, the primary strength lies in the multi-layered narrative designed to extract intelligence rather than financial gain. The campaign's use of graduated revelation, hidden Excel content, and location baiting represents an advanced approach to social engineering that requires enhanced detection capabilities and user awareness training. The SPF authentication failure and use of anonymous email services highlight the importance of robust email security policies and user education in defending against such sophisticated phishing attempts.
