## Conclusion
This analysis reveals a sophisticated attack campaign utilizing social engineering (fake invoice documents) combined with defense evasion techniques (time stomping) to deploy a backdoored UltraVNC client for persistent remote access. The attack demonstrates a well-orchestrated approach with cloud-based distribution, connectivity verification, and careful timestamp manipulation to avoid detection.
