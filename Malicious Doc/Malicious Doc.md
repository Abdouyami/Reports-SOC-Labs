### 5.3 Technical Analysis

* **File Format:** Microsoft Office Document (.doc)
* **Embedded Objects:** Malicious OLE equation object
* **Exploit Payload:** Embedded shellcode targeting EQNEDT32.EXE
* **Anti-Analysis:** Potential evasion techniques to avoid sandboxing

### 5.2 Exploitation Timeline

**Pre-Exploitation:**
* Document delivered via phishing email
* User opens document (social engineering success)

**Exploitation Phase:**
* Equation Editor processes malicious OLE object
* Stack buffer overflow triggered in EQNEDT32.EXE
* Shellcode execution achieved with the following sequence:
  - Environment string expansion for `%APPDATA%\aro.exe`
  - Dynamic library loading (UrlMon, shell32)
  - Function resolution (URLDownloadToFileW, ShellExecuteW)
  - File download from `seed-bc.com`
  - Local execution of downloaded payload

**Post-Exploitation:**
* Remote payload (`jan2.exe`) download from `185.36.74.48:80` via HTTP
* File renamed and saved as `aro.exe` in user's AppData directory
* Automatic execution of dropped file using ShellExecuteW
* Establishment of persistent access through `aro.exe`
